*seeds.txt
*************************************
FASTA files including all sequences used as seeds:
      human_seeds.txt were used to query whole genomes for OR genes
      niimura_seeds.txt were used to associate ancestral OR gene classifications with the dataset in this research

*************************************
Subsetted phylogenies annotated with their correlating ancestral genes
      OR1_trub.png shows the distribution of ancestral genes found with Takifugu rubripes seed sequences BLASTed against OR1
      OR2_drer.png shows the distribution of ancestral genes found with Danio rerio seed sequences BLASTed against OR2
      OR3_ggal.png shows the distribution of ancestral genes found with Gallus gallus seed sequences BLASTed against OR3
